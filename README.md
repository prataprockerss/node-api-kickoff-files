# Node API kickoff files

## Problem
1. As per my experince for mid level node developer it hard to write clean code. Best way to get all file setup is by using  [express genrator] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) if you writing an API so you are never going to touch Views or public folder. 
2. For API we rquired some addtinal node module which we to install manually 


## Solution
To overcome above problem I have created start up file which has all module which are required to write an api
